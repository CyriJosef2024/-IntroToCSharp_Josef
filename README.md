# Prelim Activity 01: Codac Logistics Delivery & Fuel Auditor

**Author:** Josef, Cyr Michael E. 

## Task Description

This console-based C# application is designed for Codac Logistics to track the daily fuel expenses and delivery performance of a single vehicle over a 5‑day work week. The program performs the following functions:

- Collects the driver’s full name and weekly fuel budget.
- Validates the total distance traveled (must be between 1.0 and 5000.0 km) using a `while` loop.
- Records fuel costs for each of the five days in a one‑dimensional `decimal` array and calculates the total fuel spent.
- Computes the average daily fuel expense, fuel efficiency ratio, and assigns an efficiency rating (High/Standard/Low) using `if/else` logic.
- Determines whether the driver stayed under budget and outputs a boolean status.
- Generates a comprehensive, formatted audit report that includes driver details, a daily expense breakdown, financial summaries, performance metrics, and budget compliance.

The program demonstrates fundamental C# concepts including: 
Data types - (`string`, `int`, `double`, `decimal`, `bool`)
I/O operations - (`Console.ReadLine()`) 
String Interpolation.
Control flow (`for` loops, `while` loops, `if/else`) 
Array usage.
